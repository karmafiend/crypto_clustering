Week #19 Bootcamp Challenge - Repo for Chris Kilkes' Module #19 Data Analytics Bootcamp repository challenge - Chris Kilkes 06/20/24 @ 12:55 pm PST

# What the project does:
Use of unsupervised learning models (PCA and k-Means) along with Pandas data manipulation and visualization allow users to determine if the 24 hour or 7 day crypto prices changes can be predicted. According to the analysis and visualization conducted here, there does seem to be stronger ability to predict crypto price changes over 7 days vs. 24 hours. This analysis and visualization result is indicated by the composite scatter plot chart whose results show that the PCA model shows a stronger prediction result than the k-means model (whose results shows largely a null ability to predict price changes). A helpful tool for anyone tracking and potentially investing in various crypto currencies.

# How users can get started with the project:
Download code, tweak and replicate analysis and visualization results - evaluating final results for investment consideration. and evaluate results for self. Code provides foundation for both analysis and visualization of crypto currency analysis and visualization.

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Primary sources used for this exercise were class instruction and class work along with extensive usage of PCA and k-means model documentation, specifically: Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, and Geeks for Geeks content.
